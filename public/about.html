<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  This website is part of my journey into web development — a place to learn by
  building, breaking, and fixing things.
</p>

<p>
  I’m exploring web development with a hands-on approach. I learn best by
  building things, breaking them, and figuring out how to make them better.
</p>

<p>
  Just someone learning web development, one project at a time. This website is
  where I practice and experiment.
